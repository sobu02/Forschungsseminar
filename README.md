## Project Description
This code is part of a university project. In the first step we have to download all german Wikipedia articles and try to predict if an article is an 'excellent article'. The second task is to extract only the 'excellent articles' and predict some relevant keywords from the article. We have to evaluate them with metrics and try to get the best results.
